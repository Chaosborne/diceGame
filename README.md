Rules:  
------
The game is for two players.  
You must roll the die, after which you can keep the points that have fallen out and pass the turn to another player. Or you can continue and try to get more points.  
If a 1 is rolled, the current points are forfeited and the turn passes to another player.  
A player wins when they keep their rolled points and the player's total score is equal to or greater than 100.
